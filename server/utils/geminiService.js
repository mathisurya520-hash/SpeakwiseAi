    Topic: "${topic}"
    Debate History: ${historyJson}

    Respond with your next counterargument.
    If the history contains 5 or more turns (isFinal = ${isFinal}), evaluate the user's critical thinking, persuasion, logic, and rebuttal strength, and generate an "analysis" node.

    Return a JSON object matching this schema exactly:
    {
      "content": "string (AI's next counterargument response)",
      "analysis": null OR {
        "overallScore": number (0-100),
        "metrics": {
          "criticalThinking": number (0-100),
          "persuasion": number (0-100),
          "logicScore": number (0-100),
          "counterStrength": number (0-100)
        },
        "feedback": "string",
        "leaderboardPoints": number
      }
    }`;

    const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
    return safeParseJSON(result.response.text());
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Gemini Debate failed. Falling back to mock:", error);
    return mockDebateResponse(topic, history);
  }
};
